# General Connection Framework

Description...

## Use Cases

⋅⋅* Authentication (plugins)
⋅⋅* Combining multiple dependent requests
⋅⋅* Request queueing
⋅⋅* Retry logic

## Why Use GCF?

⋅⋅* Never have to write urlsession code in your app again (cuts down on network code)
⋅⋅* Will be fully tested (no buggy network code)
⋅⋅* Easier/quicker API integration
⋅⋅* Less fragile (no string parameters for creating a request)
⋅⋅* Supports standard completion block pattern or rx/observable pattern
⋅⋅* Encourages modular design by allowing/forcing client of gcf to own the domain specific knowledge (actual url, parsed data models, etc)

## Usage

### Creating Routables

```swift
// some code
```

### Creating a GCF
