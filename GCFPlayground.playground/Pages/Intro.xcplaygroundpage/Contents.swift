# General Connection Framework

The General Connection Framework (GCF) is part of mobileforming's modularization effort.  The end result will be less time spent writing duplicated code across projects through the use of this library.  Every project utilizing the GCF will have an increased level of confidence in the network code, in addition to other shared benefits.

## Why Use GCF?
* Never have to write [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) code in your app again (cuts down on network code)
* No more JSON parsing
* Will be fully tested (no buggy network code)
* Easier/quicker API integration
* Less fragile (no string literal parameters for creating a request)
* Supports standard completion block pattern or Rx/observable pattern
* Encourages modular design
* Bain says so...


## Features
* Modular
* Highly configurable
* Flexible plugin architecture
* Swift [Decodable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/decodable) support

## Dependencies
* [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/)

## Requirements
* iOS 9.0+
* Xcode 9
* Swift 4
* [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods)

## Installation
* TBD (cocoapods)
